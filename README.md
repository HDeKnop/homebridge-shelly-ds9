# homebridge-shelly-ds9



[Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) plugin for [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud).

This is a personal project - attempting to understand a bit of javascript, typescript and hopefully improve the way my Shelly devices integrate into my home.  I do NOT know what I'm doing.

https://github.com/cubi1337/homebridge-shelly-ds9 is the branch available on npm  (homebridge-shelly-ds9)
